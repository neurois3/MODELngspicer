# ModelNgspicer

**ModelNgspicer** is a GUI application built on top of ngspice, designed to enhance workflow efficiency in circuit design optimization and device modeling. The graphical interface is developed using Python's Qt library (PySide6), allowing users to adjust model parameters via mouse wheel or numeric input and instantly visualize changes through real-time plotting.

## Features

- Interactive GUI for real-time parameter tuning
- Seemless interaction with Ngspice for immediate simulation feedback
- Visualization of simulation results with support for overlaying external reference data

## Demo

Below is a demonstration of modeling the forward and reverse I-V characteristics of a diode using ModelNgspicer.
