# [MODELngspicer](https://github.com/neurois3/MODELngspicer)

**MODELngspicer** is a GUI application built on top of ngspice, designed to help circuit design optimization and device modeling. The graphical interface is developed using Qt library (PySide6), allowing users to adjust circuit parameters intuitively and visualize simulation results in real time. This seamless integration between control and feedback enables rapid iteration and deeper insight into circuit behavior.

## Features

- Intuitive graphical interface for parameter tuning
- Real-time visualization of simulation results
- Light and dark UI themes
- Code editor with SPICE syntax highlighting
- Save and load settings
- Examples of modeling diodes, transistors and filters
