D_FORWARD_IV.spice
* This script performs a DC sweep of forward voltage across a diode
* to extract its forward current characteristics.

* Diode model
.model DIODE1 D (
.include model.txt
+ )

* Test circuit
VF  n01 0   dc 0        $ Forward voltage source
VIF n01 n02 dc 0        $ Forward current probe
D1  n02 0   DIODE1      $ Test diode

.control
option TEMP=25          $ Set simulation temperature to 25Â°C

* Sweep VF from 0.3 V to 1.5 V in 0.01 V steps
dc VF 0.3 1.5 0.01

* Write forward current data to file
