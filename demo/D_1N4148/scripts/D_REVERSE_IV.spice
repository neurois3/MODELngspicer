D_REVERSE_IV.spice
* This script performs a DC sweep of reverse voltage across a diode
* to extract its reverse current characteristics, including breakdown behavior.

* Diode model
.model DIODE1 D (
.include model.txt
+ )

* Test circuit
VR  n01 0   dc 0        $ Reverse voltage source
VIR n01 n02 dc 0        $ Reverse current probe
D1  0   n02 DIODE1      $ Test diode

.control
option TEMP=25          $ Set simulation temperature to 25Â°C
option GMIN=4e-10       $ Set minimum conductance

* Sweep VR from 10 V to 146 V in 1 V steps
dc VR 10 146 1

* Write reverse current data to file
